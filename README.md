# emotion-sentiment-api
  The Real-Time Emotion &amp; Sentiment Analysis API understands human feelings from textâ€”like happiness, sadness, or frustration. Using Git as a database, it stores and tracks emotion-tagged chats transparently. This project helps build empathetic AI for customer support, social media, healthcare, and beyond.
